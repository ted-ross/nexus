List of things that need to be done:

=====
Add logging to the mt_server module.

=====
Add listener configuration for SASL and TLS/SSL.
Add "server" function calls for opening and closing connectors and listeners.

=====
Refactor the API for the container to deal in node-types rather than nodes.
Allow node-types to register and then be instantiated via configuration or
by dynamic attach.  Dyanmic nodes can be deleted when there are no remaining
attached links.

=====
Add a simple mechanism for modules to expose state and statistics.

=====
Add a configuration reader (XML httpd-style)

=====
Router Notes:

- Router detects munged reply-to headers and replaces them with a routable address.
  o if addr is ...//<container-id>/something it is munged (accept //_reply_ also)
  o replace with ...//<routable or mobile>/something
    x use mobile or routable depending on the source of the link
  o re-munge on egress? no

- Ingress node puts origin header on message

- Trace may not be needed
  o Trace can be added if the message has a trace header

- Message structure has two deliveries (incoming and outgoing)
  o allows disposition and settlement to be transitive
  o locally terminated are settled immediately

- Transitive disposition for unicast addresses
  o If message ids undeliverable, use 'released' disposition
  o downstream delivery comes back relesaed, 
    x send in alternate direction if known or
    x release back to the upstream
    x if we are the origin, we can hold the message for a bit to see if a
      topology change is in calculation.
